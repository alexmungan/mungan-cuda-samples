This repo contains the implementations of various alogrithms using CUDA gpu programming. The goal is to examine
the different approaches to develop efficient gpu code and learn why that approach is effective. 

Makefiles are provided in each project directory to handle compilation. The entire repository should be cloned to 
ensure that all header files, data, and other dependencies can be found.
